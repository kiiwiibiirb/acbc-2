# Animal Crossing Bell Calculator 2 (ACBC-2)
This is the second revision of my Animal Crossing Bell Calculator, where you can calculate how many bells you will earn from selling a certain amount of bugs or fish!

# Why make a different repository for the second version?
This version (and subsequent versions) are different in terms both the frontend and backend. Before the ACBC was command line only and was very ugly in terms of how it output the results. This version is still made in Lua but with some differences such as...
- Uses a GUI (thanks to Love2D)
- Has every item sellable in Animal Crossing New Horizons
- Has an executable for Windows macOS and Linux, rather than the user having to run `lua main.lua`
